# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**- About:-**
Job Tracker is a React-based application designed to help users manage and keep track of recent job openings. The app allows users to view detailed information about each job, including the job title, company, location, salary, and job description. Users can easily add new job listings, edit existing ones, or delete jobs that are no longer relevant. This app aims to simplify the job search process by providing a centralized platform to organize and monitor job opportunities efficiently. 📋💼🔍
